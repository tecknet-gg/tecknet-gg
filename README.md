Hallo, my name is tecknet, or tecknet-gg because tecknet was taken, but tecknet was taken too before I stole it from some random mouse brand when I was like 6.
Anyways I don't usually ever commit projects publically, but if I have, well done me.
Am I good at coding? Of course not, but at the end of the day, who is?
I "code" in C++(Arduino stuff) and Java.
I like video games(who doesn't).
This is all irrelevant, skedaddle, don't you have anything better to do?
